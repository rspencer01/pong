Pong
====

A very, very simple game.  Mostly using it to test the game engine of [Project Magrathea](https://github.com/rspencer01/PM4).

## Running
Runnning the game should be as simple as
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
./pong
~~~

I'm working on creating standalone executables with Pyinstaller so that dependencies are managed.

## Controls
Controls are <kbd>Q</kbd> and <kbd>A</kbd> for the left hand player and <kbd>P</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> for the right.
